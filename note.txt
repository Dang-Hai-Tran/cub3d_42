Except for the map content, each type of element can be separated by one or
more empty line(s).
◦Except for the map content which always has to be the last, each type of
element can be set in any order in the file.
◦Except for the map, each type of information from an element can be separated
by one or more space(s).
◦The map must be parsed as it looks in the file. Spaces are a valid part of the
map and are up to you to handle. You must be able to parse any kind of map,
as long as it respects the rules of the map.

Each element (except the map) firsts information is the type identifier (com-
posed by one or two character(s)), followed by all specific informations for each
object in a strict order such as :
∗ North texture:
NO ./path_to_the_north_texture
· identifier: NO
· path to the north texure
∗ South texture:
SO ./path_to_the_south_texture
· identifier: SO
· path to the south texure
∗ West texture:
WE ./path_to_the_west_texture
· identifier: WE
· path to the west texure
∗ East texture:
EA ./path_to_the_east_texture
· identifier: EA
· path to the east texure
∗ Floor color:
F 220,100,0
· identifier: F
· R,G,B colors in range [0,255]: 0, 255, 255
∗ Ceiling color:
C 225,30,0
· identifier: C
· R,G,B colors in range [0,255]: 0, 255, 255
